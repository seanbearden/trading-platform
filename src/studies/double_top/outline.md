# Double Top (Bottom) Signal
Applying technical analysis to stock chart patterns, the double top or double bottom signal is observed often enough 
that it cannot be ignored. The pattern can imply mean reversion is probable. The purpose of this study is to 
identify an estimate for this probability.

Double tops can become multi tops, 
which would not benefit a short position if purchased 
after the double top is identified. A study needs to be conducted to determine when a double top is an entry signal.

## Notes
* peaks should be reasonable separated in time, but should not have extreme lows between.
* need to identify how far the price can move

## Investigate
* How long after the second top before entry?
* What can be learned from the dip between peaks?
* How can the Ichimoku cloud serve as a secondary indicator? For example, double top starts to fall above cloud. 
  What can be learned when it interacts with the top of the cloud, then the bottom of the cloud?
* How to avoid a multi top after second top?

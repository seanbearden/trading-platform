# MACD Trading Strategy

The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a securityâ€™s price. Here's a detailed strategy using the MACD indicator:

## 1. **Setting up MACD on the Chart:**

- **MACD Line:** Subtract the 26-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) from the 12-period EMA.
- **Signal Line:** 9-period EMA of the MACD line.
- **MACD Histogram:** MACD Line - Signal Line.

```plaintext
MACD Line: (12-period EMA - 26-period EMA)
Signal Line: 9-period EMA of MACD Line
MACD Histogram: MACD Line - Signal Line
```

## 2. **Basic Signals:**

### a. Buy Signal:

- **Crossover:** Buy when the MACD Line crosses above the Signal Line.
- **Zero Line Crossover:** Buy when the MACD Line crosses above zero.

```plaintext
if (MACD Line > Signal Line) or (MACD Line > 0) then Buy
```

### b. Sell Signal:

- **Crossover:** Sell when the MACD Line crosses below the Signal Line.
- **Zero Line Crossover:** Sell when the MACD Line crosses below zero.

```plaintext
if (MACD Line < Signal Line) or (MACD Line < 0) then Sell
```

## 3. **Confirmation:**

- It's advisable to wait for additional confirmation before entering a trade. For instance, a supportive candlestick pattern or a supportive trend in other indicators like RSI or Stochastics.

## 4. **Divergences:**

- **Bullish Divergence:** When the price makes a lower low, but the MACD makes a higher low, it may indicate a potential upward reversal.
